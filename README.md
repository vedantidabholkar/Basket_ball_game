🏀 Unity Basketball Game

A fun and interactive 3D basketball game built in Unity, where players can aim, shoot, and score! The project features realistic ball physics, dynamic scoring (2-point and 3-point zones), and a smooth shooting mechanic that responds to how long you hold the shot button.

Includes systems for:

🏆 Scoring, high-score tracking, and player name saving

🎯 Crosshair power indicator & speed feedback

🕹️ Player movement and camera rotation controls

⏱️ Level timer and game-over screen
